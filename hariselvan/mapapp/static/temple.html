<h1 class="co">GOLDEN TEMPLE</h1>
 <p class="para">The Golden Temple, also known as the Sripuram Golden Temple, is a spiritual park located in Thirumalaikodi, near Vellore in Tamil Nadu. It is dedicated to Goddess Lakshmi Narayani and is managed by the Sri Narayani Peedam led by Sri Sakthi Amma, a spiritual leader. The temple is renowned for its stunning architecture and intricate design, with the temple's Vimanam (tower) and Ardha Mandapam covered in pure gold foil, making it a unique and visually striking landmark. Spread across 100 acres of lush green land, the temple is not just a place of worship but also promotes values like peace, spirituality, and environmental consciousness. Pilgrims walk along a star-shaped path that stretches for over 1.8 kilometers to reach the sanctum, allowing for spiritual reflection. The Golden Temple has become a major tourist attraction and pilgrimage site, drawing thousands of visitors every day from across India and abroad..</p>
