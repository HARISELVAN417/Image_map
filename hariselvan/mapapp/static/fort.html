<h1 class="co">VELLORE FORT</h1>
 <p class="para">The Vellore Fort is a magnificent historical structure located in the heart of Vellore, Tamil Nadu. Built in the 16th century by the Vijayanagara kings, this fort is known for its grand granite walls, wide moat, and robust military architecture. It has witnessed several key historical events, including the Vellore Sepoy Mutiny of 1806, which was one of the earliest uprisings against British rule in India. The fort has been under the control of various dynasties, such as the Bijapur Sultans, Marathas, the Carnatic Nawabs, and eventually the British. One of the unique features of the Vellore Fort is that it houses a Hindu temple (Jalakanteswarar Temple), a church, and a mosque within its premises, showcasing religious harmony. The Jalakanteswarar Temple inside the fort is particularly famous for its exquisite carvings and Dravidian-style architecture. Today, the Vellore Fort is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India and stands as a symbol of the city's rich cultural and historical heritage, attracting tourists and history enthusiasts from all over.</p>
