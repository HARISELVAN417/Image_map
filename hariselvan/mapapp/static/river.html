<h1 class="co">PALARU RIVER</h1>
 <p class="para">The Palar River, originating from the Nandi Hills in Karnataka's Chikkaballapura district, traverses through Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu before emptying into the Bay of Bengal near Vayalur, south of Chennai. Covering a total length of approximately 357 kilometers, it flows for about 222 kilometers through Tamil Nadu, significantly impacting regions like Vellore. ​

    In the Vellore district, the Palar River has historically been a vital water source for agriculture and drinking purposes. However, in recent years, the river has faced challenges due to erratic water flow and environmental concerns. Notably, industrial activities, particularly from tanneries in Vellore, have led to significant pollution. The Supreme Court of India acknowledged in February 2025 that these tanneries caused "irreversible damage" to the water bodies, groundwater, and agricultural lands by discharging untreated or partially treated effluents into the Palar River. The court directed the Tamil Nadu government to compensate those affected and recover the costs from the polluting units. ​

    Efforts are underway to address these issues and restore the river's health. The Tamil Nadu Water Resources Department has planned the construction of six check dams across the Palar River, each estimated to cost ₹30 crore. These structures aim to improve water management and support the river's ecosystem. ​

    Despite these challenges, the Palar River remains an integral part of Vellore's geography and history, influencing the region's development and sustaining its communities.</p>
